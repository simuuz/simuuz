I like emulation and reverse engineering, albeit pretty confused about everything. I tried and try to work on projects I like, often leaving them mid-way, but I still enjoy it, don't get me wrong. My GameBoy emulator, "Cowboy", only gets past the bootrom without graphics or audio, _for now_. I'm working on it. I also have a very early-dev Nintendo 64 emulator called Shibumi. It's currently into the bootcode :3
