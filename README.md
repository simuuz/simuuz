I like emulation and reverse engineering, albeit pretty confused about everything. I tried and try to work on projects I like, often leaving them mid-way, but I still enjoy it, don't get me wrong. My GB emulator, "Cowboy", only gets past the bootrom without graphics or audio, LOL. I'm currently working on an N64 emulator, and it's very early dev.
