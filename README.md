## Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Simone "simuuz" Coco, a 17 years old developer from Italy. I'm an emulation and low-level programming enthusiast.</br></br>
I'm mainly focused on developing emulators, which are all currently work in progress (natsukashii: C++ Game Boy emulator, shibumi: C++ Nintendo 64 emulator),
but I'm also working on an ARM11 dynamic assembler / emitter (project Ikigai), which will hopefully be useful for Nintendo 3DS homebrew developers to create fast programs (fast emulators on the 3DS? ðŸ‘€), and of course any other dev that works with ARM11 architechtures.</br>
Feel free to look around.
